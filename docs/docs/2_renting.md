# Renting a Server

## 1. Choose a server type

There are currently two choices for types of servers to rent:

1. Stable Diffusion GPU Server that runs Automatic1111
2. Burstable CPU Server that runs Docker and Portainer

Each server type is offered with different amount of processing power, depending on your needs.

## 2. Choose a region

Normally you would choose a region that is closest to your location for the best performance. However, there are resource limits in each region, and so sometimes you may need to change the region to be able to rent a server.

## 3. Choose number of hours

The amount of hours you pick will determine your deposit needed. The hours you choose determines when the server will expire without taking further action. Remember you can terminate the server early and get a refund for remaining time, and you can also extend a rental.

## 4. Submit Transactions

First, you will need to submit an approval transaction to allow the contract to deposit your USDC. Then you will submit the transaction that reserves your server. Once the transaction completes, your server will be created, and it will begin starting up.

## 5. Sign in to your server

After your server rental transaction completes, you will be taken to server page. To interact with your server, you will need to sign in. Click the "Sign in to use Server" button to start the process. Your wallet will ask you to sign a message, which will act as your login credentials. This ensures only you can control your server. Once you sign in, you can see the server status and controls.

## 6. Wait for the server to finish starting

If you sign into your server right away, the server will most likely not be started yet. Please be patient.

#### Stable Diffusion

Takes around 3 minutes to startup. You will see the Automatic1111 UI when it is ready.

#### Docker

Takes around 1 minute to startup. You will see the Portainer UI when it is ready. For security reasons, make sure to create an admin password right away.
