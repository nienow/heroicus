## Server Controls

### Extend Server

You can extend your rental as long as your rental is still active. It will ask you to approve and deposit USDC for the added hours.

If your rental is expired, you have to rent a new server.

### Terminate Server

Terminating your server will stop the server and erase any data. The contract will send you a refund for time remaining, minus 1 minute to account for the time of stopping the server.

### Restart Server

You have the option to reboot your server. This should generally only be used if there is a problem with the server. For example, if the server is unresponsive or is not working correctly.
