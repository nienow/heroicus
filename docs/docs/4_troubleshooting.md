## Common Errors

### Insufficient resources available to create server. A full refund was issued.

Sometimes there are not enough resources in a region to create a new server. It is not possible to know this ahead of time. When this occurs, you should automatically receive a full refund.

Please try a new region or wait a couple of hours and try again.

### An error occurred. Please stop server to get a refund.

This error occurs if the server does not start because of an unknown error, and we couldn't grant you an automatic refund. Please stop the server manually to get a refund for remaining time.
