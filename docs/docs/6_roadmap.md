# Roadmap

## Next steps

### 1. Cheaper rentals

We need to lower the cost of the server rentals to be competitive. There are a few different optimizations we can do.

### 2. More server options

1. Allows users for fine-grained controls over server specs.
2. Allow users to rent a plain linux server with full access to SSH, SCP, etc. This will allow the user to install anything they want on the server.

### 3. Persistent Rentals

Allow users to stop servers without terminating them, persisting the data on a hard drive. This will require a separate hard drive fee, which will be very low compared to the server fee.

### 4. Security

Install SSL certificates on servers for encrypted connections.
