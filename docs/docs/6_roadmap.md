# Roadmap

## Next steps

### 1. Cheaper rentals

We need to lower the cost of the server rentals to be competitive. There are a few different optimizations we can do.

### 2. Faster startups for Stable Diffusion servers

There are optimizations we can do to make the servers startup faster, but it will take more time and research.

### 3. More server options

1. Allow for fine-grained controls over server specs.
2. Have more server template options.

### 4. Persistent Rentals

Allow users to stop servers without terminating them, persisting the data on a hard drive. This will require a separate hard drive fee, which will be very low compared to the server fee.

### 5. Security

Install SSL certificates on servers for encrypted connections. Set a more strict network security policy.
